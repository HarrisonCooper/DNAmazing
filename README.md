##Â DNAmazing ARAlert
ARAlert is a tool for diagnosing Antibiotic Resistance (AR) rapidly using nanopore long read technology and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD).

ONT reads are aligned to known AR genes in CARD using Burrows Wheeler Alignment (BWA) and the corresponding antibiotics are identified from the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO).

Discovering antibiotic resistance is a time sensitive matter. To fully utilise the speed of ONT sequencing, and to speed up time from sample to diagnosis, ARAlert includes automated text messaging and email reports using Nexmo API, to alert doctors as soon as results are available.
